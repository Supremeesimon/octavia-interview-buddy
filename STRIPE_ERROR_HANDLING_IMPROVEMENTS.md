# Stripe Integration Error Handling Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to error handling in the Stripe integration to better align with the project's specifications for handling expected states and providing appropriate user feedback.

## Changes Made

### 1. BillingControls Component
- **Improved error handling** for data fetching operations
- **Graceful handling of 404/400 errors** for expected empty states:
  - Session pool data (new institutions may not have session pools yet)
  - Payment methods (institutions may not have saved payment methods)
  - Billing history (new institutions may not have purchase history)
- **Selective toast notifications**:
  - Network errors (no connection) - Shows toast
  - Server errors (5xx) - Shows toast
  - Client errors (4xx) - Logs silently, no toast
- **More specific error messages** for different error types

### 2. SessionPurchase Component
- **Enhanced error handling** for session purchase operations
- **Differentiated error responses**:
  - Server errors (5xx) - Shows specific toast
  - Client errors (4xx) - Shows validation message
  - Network errors - Shows connection issue message
- **Improved user feedback** with more descriptive error messages

### 3. SessionService
- **Unified error handling pattern** across all methods
- **Consistent approach to 404/400 errors**:
  - `getSessionPurchases`: Returns empty array for 404/400, shows toast for network/server errors
  - `getPaymentMethods`: Returns empty array for 404/400, shows toast for network/server errors
  - `getInvoices`: Returns empty array for 404/400, shows toast for network/server errors
- **Preserved toast notifications** for user-initiated actions that fail:
  - `createSessionPurchase`: Shows toast for all errors (user is actively trying to purchase)
  - `savePaymentMethod`: Shows toast for all errors (user is actively trying to save)

## Key Improvements

### Before
- Generic "Data loading failed" toast for all errors
- Toast notifications for expected empty states (404s)
- No differentiation between error types

### After
- **Selective error notifications** following project guidelines:
  - 404/400 errors for expected states → Silent handling with console logging
  - Network errors → User-facing toast notifications
  - Server errors (5xx) → User-facing toast notifications
  - User-initiated action failures → Always show toast notifications
- **More descriptive error messages** tailored to error types
- **Better user experience** with fewer unnecessary error notifications

## Testing Verification

The improvements have been verified to:
- ✅ Handle 404 responses gracefully without showing toast messages
- ✅ Show appropriate toast notifications for network errors
- ✅ Show appropriate toast notifications for server errors
- ✅ Maintain existing functionality for successful operations
- ✅ Follow the project's "Real Data Usage Policy" and error handling guidelines

## Impact

These changes improve the user experience by:
1. Reducing unnecessary error notifications for expected states
2. Providing more meaningful error messages when errors do occur
3. Maintaining visibility of actual problems (network issues, server errors)
4. Following established project patterns for error handling
