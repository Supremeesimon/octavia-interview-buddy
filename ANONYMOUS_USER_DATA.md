# Anonymous User Data Collection

## Overview
Octavia Interview Buddy collects interview data for both authenticated and anonymous users. This document explains how data collection works for anonymous users and what data is stored.

## Data Collection for Anonymous Users

### What Data is Collected
When an anonymous user completes an interview, the following data is collected and stored:

1. **Call Information**
   - Call ID (generated by VAPI)
   - Interview duration
   - Timestamp of the interview

2. **Interview Content**
   - Full transcript of the conversation
   - Recording URL (if available)
   - Interview type (e.g., general, technical, behavioral)

3. **Analysis Data**
   - Summary of the interview
   - Structured data including categories and scores
   - Success evaluation with overall score
   - Identified strengths
   - Areas for improvement
   - Personalized recommendations

### What Data is NOT Collected for Anonymous Users
- Personal identification information
- Student ID
- Department ID
- Institution ID
- Email address
- Any other personally identifiable information

### Data Storage
All data is stored in Firebase Firestore in the following collections:

1. `end-of-call-analysis` - Contains the detailed interview analysis
2. `interviews` - Contains basic interview session information

### Data Access
- Anonymous users can access their data only during their current session
- To access historical data, anonymous users must create an account
- All data is stored securely and complies with privacy regulations

### Verification
You can verify that anonymous user data is being collected by:

1. Running the test script:
   ```bash
   npm run test-anonymous-data
   ```

2. Checking the Firebase console for entries without studentId values

3. Using the Anonymous Data Checker page at `/analytics/anonymous-data`

## Privacy Considerations
- No personally identifiable information is stored for anonymous users
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Data is retained according to our privacy policy
- Anonymous users can request data deletion through our support system

## Converting to Authenticated User
When an anonymous user creates an account:
1. Their interview data can be associated with their new account
2. They gain access to historical interview data
3. They can track their progress over time
4. They receive personalized recommendations via email
