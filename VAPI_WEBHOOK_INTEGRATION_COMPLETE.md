# VAPI Webhook Integration - Complete and Working

## Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The VAPI webhook integration with Firebase is now complete and working correctly.

## Verification Results

1. **Webhook URL**: https://us-central1-octavia-practice-interviewer.cloudfunctions.net/vapiWebhook
   - ✅ Successfully deployed
   - ✅ Accepting POST requests
   - ✅ Properly validating incoming data

2. **Firebase Function**: `functions/index.js`
   - ✅ Processing end-of-call reports
   - ✅ Saving data to Firestore collection `end-of-call-analysis`
   - ✅ Handling errors gracefully

3. **Data Flow**:
   - ✅ VAPI sends end-of-call reports to webhook
   - ✅ Firebase Function receives and processes data
   - ✅ Data saved to Firestore with proper structure

4. **Test Results**:
   - ✅ Manual webhook test successful
   - ✅ Real interview data captured (document ID: mjkrPvSneLiy3Zinf22L)
   - ✅ Test data captured (document ID: iIRr2stbTVOnBfjddkYV)

## Data Structure

The webhook saves data with the following structure:
- `callId`: Unique identifier for the call
- `startedAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when call started
- `endedAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when call ended
- `endedReason`: Reason the call ended
- `cost`: Cost of the call
- `compliance`: Compliance information
- `transcript`: Full transcript of the call
- `recordingUrl`: URL to the call recording
- `summary`: Summary of the call
- `structuredData`: Structured analysis data
- `successEvaluation`: Evaluation of call success
- `duration`: Duration of call in seconds
- `studentId`: Student identifier from metadata
- `departmentId`: Department identifier from metadata
- `institutionId`: Institution identifier from metadata
- `interviewType`: Interview type from metadata

## VAPI Dashboard Configuration

The VAPI dashboard is properly configured with:
- Webhook URL: https://us-central1-octavia-practice-interviewer.cloudfunctions.net/vapiWebhook
- Event Selection: "End of Call Report" events only
- Request Body Schema: Properly defined with all required properties

## Next Steps

1. Continue using the system for interviews
2. Monitor Firestore for data consistency
3. Consider implementing additional features like:
   - Email notifications for completed interviews
   - Data export functionality
   - Advanced analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise in the future:
1. Check Firebase Function logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Verify VAPI dashboard configuration
3. Test webhook with `test-webhook.mjs` script
4. Check Firestore data with `check-firestore-data.mjs` script

The integration is robust and should handle all future interviews automatically.
