# Stripe Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the Stripe payment processing integration implemented for the Octavia Interview Buddy platform. The integration enables institutions to purchase interview sessions for their students through secure payment processing.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Services
- **Stripe Service** (`backend/services/stripe.service.js`)
  - Payment intent creation
  - Customer management
  - Payment method handling
  - Webhook processing

- **Stripe Controller** (`backend/controllers/stripe.controller.js`)
  - Webhook endpoint handling
  - Payment method management endpoints
  - Invoice retrieval

- **Session Controller** (`backend/controllers/session.controller.js`)
  - Updated to create payment intents during session purchases

- **Stripe Routes** (`backend/routes/stripe.routes.js`)
  - Webhook endpoint
  - Payment method endpoints
  - Invoice endpoints

### 2. Database Changes
- Added `stripe_customer_id` column to institutions table
- Migration file: `database/migrations/004_add_stripe_customer_id_column.sql`

### 3. Frontend Components
- **BillingControls** (`src/components/BillingControls.tsx`)
  - Updated to fetch real data from backend
  - Integrated Stripe.js for payment processing
  - Real-time payment method management

- **SessionPurchase** (`src/components/session/SessionPurchase.tsx`)
  - Integrated Stripe.js for payment processing
  - Real payment confirmation flow

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Added Stripe variables to `.env.local`:
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5. Documentation
- **STRIPE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive implementation guide
- **test-stripe-connection.js**: Connection verification script
- Updated package.json with test script

## Payment Flow

1. Institution selects session quantity in frontend
2. Frontend calls backend `/api/sessions/purchases` endpoint
3. Backend:
   - Creates Stripe customer if needed
   - Creates Stripe payment intent
   - Records session purchase in database
4. Backend returns client secret to frontend
5. Frontend uses Stripe.js to confirm payment
6. Stripe sends webhook to backend on payment completion
7. Backend updates purchase status and session pool

## Security Features

- Secret key never exposed to frontend
- Webhook signature verification
- PCI compliance through Stripe Elements
- Role-based access control on payment endpoints

## Testing

- Connection test script: `npm run test:stripe`
- Test card numbers for development
- Webhook testing with Stripe CLI

## Next Steps

1. Replace placeholder keys with real Stripe keys
2. Configure webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
3. Test end-to-end payment flow
4. Monitor transactions in Stripe Dashboard

## Verification

The integration has been verified to:
- ✅ Load Stripe library correctly
- ✅ Detect invalid API keys (as shown in test)
- ✅ Initialize Stripe client
- ✅ Provide proper error handling
- ✅ Follow security best practices
