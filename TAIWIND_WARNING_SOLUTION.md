# Solution for "@tailwind css(unknownAtRules)" Warning

## Problem
The warning "Unknown at rule @tailwind css(unknownAtRules)" appears because the CSS language server in IDEs doesn't recognize Tailwind CSS's custom at-rules (@tailwind, @apply, etc.).

## Solutions

### 1. IDE Configuration (Recommended)
Add the following to your VS Code settings.json:
```json
{
  "css.lint.unknownAtRules": "ignore",
  "scss.lint.unknownAtRules": "ignore",
  "less.lint.unknownAtRules": "ignore"
}
```

### 2. Install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension
Install the official "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" extension for VS Code which properly recognizes Tailwind directives.

### 3. CSS Comments Approach
Wrap Tailwind directives with stylelint comments:
```css
/* stylelint-disable at-rule-no-unknown */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
/* stylelint-enable at-rule-no-unknown */
```

This has already been implemented in your src/index.css file.

## Note
These warnings are purely cosmetic and don't affect functionality. Tailwind CSS works perfectly regardless of these warnings.
