# Phase 1: Data Interconnection Audit

## 1.5 Data Interconnection Audit - Map data flow between role dashboards

### Shared Data Points Across Dashboards

#### 1. User Context Data
- **User Profile Information**: Name, email, role, institution affiliation
- **Authentication Status**: Login state, session information
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Access levels and capabilities

#### 2. Student Data
- **Basic Information**: Name, email, department, year of study
- **Interview Data**: Scheduled interviews, completed interviews, scores
- **Resume Data**: Upload status, views, downloads, improvements
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics, skill assessments, improvement rates

#### 3. Institution Data
- **Institution Profile**: Name, domain, settings, statistics
- **Department Information**: Department names, student/teacher counts
- **License Management**: Total licenses, used licenses, allocation status
- **Engagement Metrics**: Active users, session utilization, feature usage

#### 4. Analytics Data
- **Performance Metrics**: Average scores, completion rates, improvement trends
- **Feature Usage**: Most used features, user engagement patterns
- **Department Comparisons**: Performance across different departments
- **Platform Intelligence**: System-wide metrics and insights

#### 5. Communication Data
- **Messages/Notifications**: Announcements, system updates, engagement messages
- **Feedback Systems**: Interview feedback, user suggestions
- **Reports**: Performance reports, usage statistics, export data

### Data Flow Patterns for Each Role

#### Platform Admin
```
[Firestore: platformAdmins] → [RBAC Service] → [AdminDashboard Component]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions] → [Institution Service] → [Institution Management]
     ↓
[Firestore: financial_analytics] → [Financial Service] → [Platform Analytics]
     ↓
[Firestore: system_config] → [System Service] → [System Management]
```

#### Institution Admin
```
[Auth Context: user.institutionId] → [Institution Hierarchy Service]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}] → [Institution Service] → [InstitutionDashboard Component]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments] → [Department Data]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/students] → [Student Management]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/teachers] → [Teacher Management]
     ↓
[Firestore: interviews (filtered by studentId)] → [Interview Data]
     ↓
[Firestore: end-of-call-analysis (filtered by studentId)] → [Analytics Data]
```

#### Teacher
```
[Auth Context: user.institutionId, user.departmentId] → [Institution Hierarchy Service]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/teachers/{teacherId}] → [TeacherDashboard Component]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/students] → [Student Data]
     ↓
[Firestore: interviews (filtered by studentId)] → [Interview Management]
     ↓
[Firestore: end-of-call-analysis (filtered by studentId)] → [Performance Analytics]
```

#### Student
```
[Auth Context: user.id] → [Firebase Auth Service]
     ↓
[Firestore: institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/students/{studentId}] → [StudentDashboard Component]
     ↓
[Firestore: interviews (where studentId == user.id)] → [Interview History]
     ↓
[Firestore: interview-feedback (where interviewId in studentInterviews)] → [Feedback Data]
     ↓
[Firestore: end-of-call-analysis (where studentId == user.id)] → [Performance Analytics]
     ↓
[Firestore: student-stats/{studentId}] → [Personal Statistics]
```

### Cross-Dashboard Data Relationships

#### 1. Hierarchical Data Flow
- Platform Admin → Institution Admin → Teacher → Student
- Data flows down the hierarchy with appropriate filtering and permissions

#### 2. Lateral Data Sharing
- Teachers within the same department can view shared student data
- Institution Admins can view all department data within their institution
- Platform Admins can view all institution data

#### 3. Analytics Aggregation
- Student-level data aggregates to Teacher-level analytics
- Teacher/Department-level data aggregates to Institution-level analytics
- Institution-level data aggregates to Platform-level analytics

### Data Access Patterns

#### Read Patterns
1. **Direct Access**: User directly accesses their own data
2. **Filtered Access**: User accesses subset of data based on role/permissions
3. **Aggregated Access**: User views summarized data from multiple sources

#### Write Patterns
1. **Self-Update**: Users update their own profile/settings
2. **Role-Based Updates**: Users with specific roles update relevant data
3. **System Updates**: Automated processes update analytics/statistics

#### Real-Time Patterns
1. **User Presence**: Login/logout status updates
2. **Interview Status**: Real-time interview progress updates
3. **Analytics Updates**: Live performance metric updates

### Security and Privacy Considerations

#### Data Isolation
- Each institution's data is isolated from others
- Department-level data isolation within institutions
- Student data privacy protection

#### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all data access
- Permission validation before data retrieval
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

#### Data Validation
- Input validation for all data writes
- Type checking for data consistency
- Error handling for failed operations
