### Working Features (Currently Using Mock Data)

1. **UI Components**
   - All tabs and navigation
   - Tables and data display components
   - Forms and input fields
   - Buttons and interactive elements
   - Toast notifications
   - Progress indicators

2. **Basic Functionality**
   - Tab switching
   - Search and filtering
   - Data display and formatting
   - Export functionality (UI only)
   - Copy to clipboard functionality

3. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design
   - Loading states
   - Error handling (UI only)
   - Collapsible sections
   - Tooltips and help text

### Broken/Mock Features (Need Real Data Integration)

1. **Data Integration Issues**
   - Student data is hardcoded mock data
   - Interview data is hardcoded mock data
   - Analytics data is hardcoded mock data
   - Institution data is not fetched from Firestore
   - User context is not properly utilized

2. **Backend Connection Issues**
   - Student approval/rejection does not connect to backend
   - Settings save does not persist data
   - Export functionality only shows toast message
   - No real-time data updates
   - No data validation or error handling from backend

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Institution ID is hardcoded instead of fetched from user context
   - No role-based data filtering
   - No permission checks for actions

### Specific Issues Identified

#### Student Management
- Mock student data array is used instead of Firestore data
- Student approval/rejection functions show toast but don't update backend
- No real student creation or editing functionality

#### Interview Management
- Scheduled interviews are mock data
- No integration with actual interview scheduling system
- No real-time interview status updates

#### Analytics Dashboard
- All analytics data is hardcoded
- No connection to actual analytics services
- No real performance metrics calculation

#### License Management
- License counts are hardcoded
- No integration with actual license tracking system
- No real license allocation functionality

#### Settings Management
- Settings are not persisted
- No connection to institution configuration in Firestore
- No validation of input data

### Dependencies and Integration Points Needed

1. **Firestore Integration**
   - Replace mock data with real Firestore queries
   - Implement proper data fetching hooks
   - Add error handling for Firestore operations

2. **Authentication Context**
   - Use real user context from Firebase Auth
   - Implement role-based data access
   - Add permission checks for actions

3. **Service Layer Integration**
   - Connect to InstitutionDashboardService
   - Use existing services where possible
   - Implement proper data transformation

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Implement Firestore listeners for real-time data
   - Add proper loading and error states
   - Handle data synchronization issues

### Performance Considerations

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add query optimization
   - Use caching where appropriate

2. **Component Rendering**
   - Optimize rendering for large tables
   - Implement virtual scrolling if needed
   - Add proper loading states

3. **Network Usage**
   - Minimize unnecessary data fetching
   - Implement proper data filtering on backend
   - Add offline support where possible
