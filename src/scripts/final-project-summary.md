  - getInstitutionStudents()
  - getInstitutionTeachers()
  - getScheduledInterviews()
  - getStudentAnalytics()
  - getResumeAnalytics()
  - getInterviewAnalytics()
  - getPlatformEngagement()

### Enhanced Existing Services

  - DashboardHeader
  - DashboardStats
  - TabsContainer
    - StudentsTab
    - ApprovalsTab
    - InterviewsTab
    - AnalyticsTab
    - ReportsTab
    - SettingsTab

### Data Architecture
- **institutions**: Root collection containing all institutions
- **departments**: Subcollection under institutions
- **teachers**: Subcollection under departments
- **students**: Subcollection under departments
- **interviews**: Root collection with references to students
- **end-of-call-analysis**: Root collection linked to interviews
- **financial_analytics**: Root collection for financial data
- **institution_interests**: Root collection for institution requests
- **system_config**: Configuration data

## Success Criteria

The project is designed to meet all success criteria:
- ✅ All Mock Data Removed
- ✅ All Features Functional
- ✅ All Roles Contextualized
- ✅ All Dashboards Interconnected
- ✅ All Tests Pass
- ✅ Production Ready

## Critical Implementation Rules

### NEVER Rules (Things that must not be done)
- Skip the audit phase - You must understand existing code first
- Create duplicate services - Check if method already exists
- Hardcode institution IDs - Always get from user context
- Use mock data - Only real Firestore data
- Ignore security rules - Respect role-based access
- Forget error handling - Every Firestore query can fail
- Skip testing - Test each feature before moving on
- Reinvent the wheel - Use existing services and scripts
- Ignore loading states - Users need feedback
- Leave console.logs - Clean up debug code

### ALWAYS Rules (Things that must be done)
- Check existing services first - Reuse before creating
- Use TypeScript types - Type safety prevents bugs
- Handle all states - Loading, error, empty, success
- Test with Admin SDK - Verify data integrity
- Follow role-based access - Filter data by user role
- Optimize queries - Use where clauses, limit results
- Document your code - Future you will thank you
- Ask before assumptions - Clarify requirements
- Test edge cases - Empty data, errors, large datasets
- Clean up mock data - Remove all traces

## Required Tools & Access
- Firebase Admin SDK access
- Existing services (InstitutionHierarchyService, RBACService, etc.)
- Existing scripts in /src/scripts/ directory
- Firestore security rules understanding
- Environment variables configured

## Next Steps

With all planning and documentation complete, the project is ready for implementation. The team should:

1. Begin Sprint 1 development work
2. Implement InstitutionDashboardService methods
3. Update RBAC system for institution-level permissions
4. Enhance authentication hooks
5. Begin unit testing
6. Follow the service-first approach for each sprint
7. Test thoroughly after each implementation
8. Document all changes
9. Validate with Admin SDK scripts
10. Complete manual testing checklists

This comprehensive planning ensures a smooth implementation process with clear guidelines, reducing risks and ensuring quality delivery of the Institution Dashboard Real Data Integration project.
