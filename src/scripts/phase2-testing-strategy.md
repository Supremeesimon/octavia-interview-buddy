2. **RBACService Enhancement Testing**
   - Test institution-level permission checks
   - Validate role hierarchy enforcement
   - Test cross-role data access restrictions
   - Verify error handling for unauthorized access

3. **Authentication Hook Testing**
   - Test user context initialization
   - Validate institution context loading
   - Test role-based dashboard routing
   - Verify error handling for auth failures

### Component Testing
1. **Data Display Component Testing**
   - Test with empty datasets
   - Test with large datasets
   - Validate loading states
   - Test error state rendering

2. **Form Component Testing**
   - Test form validation
   - Validate submission workflows
   - Test error handling
   - Verify success state rendering

3. **Filter/Search Component Testing**
   - Test search functionality
   - Validate filter combinations
   - Test pagination
   - Verify performance with large datasets

## Integration Testing Plan

### Workflow Testing

## Admin SDK Validation Scripts

### Data Integrity Scripts
1. **Collection Validation Script**
   - Verify Firestore collection structure
   - Validate required fields
   - Check data type consistency
   - Report anomalies

2. **Relationship Validation Script**
   - Verify institution-department relationships
   - Validate student-teacher mappings
   - Check interview associations
   - Report inconsistencies

3. **Permission Validation Script**
   - Test role-based data access
   - Validate permission hierarchies
   - Check cross-role data sharing
   - Report security issues
