# Phase 3: Implementation Guidelines

This document outlines the approach and guidelines for implementing the Institution Dashboard Real Data Integration project.

## Service-First Development Approach

### Rationale
The service-first approach ensures that:
1. Business logic is encapsulated in reusable services
2. Components remain lightweight and focused on UI
3. Data fetching and manipulation is consistent across the application
4. Testing is simplified with clear separation of concerns
5. Future maintenance is easier with well-defined interfaces

### Implementation Process
1. **Start with Service Layer**
   - Create or update service methods based on requirements
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Write unit tests for each service method
   - Document service method interfaces

2. **Update Components**
   - Replace mock data imports with service method calls
   - Implement loading, error, and success states
   - Add proper user feedback for all operations
   - Ensure components handle edge cases gracefully

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Run unit tests for service methods
   - Perform manual testing of component functionality
   - Validate data integrity with Admin SDK scripts
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases

4. **Document Changes**
   - Update documentation with new service methods
