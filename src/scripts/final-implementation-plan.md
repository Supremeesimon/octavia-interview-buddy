## Critical Implementation Rules

### NEVER Rules (Things that must not be done)
1. ❌ Skip the audit phase - You must understand existing code first
2. ❌ Create duplicate services - Check if method already exists
3. ❌ Hardcode institution IDs - Always get from user context
4. ❌ Use mock data - Only real Firestore data
5. ❌ Ignore security rules - Respect role-based access
6. ❌ Forget error handling - Every Firestore query can fail
7. ❌ Skip testing - Test each feature before moving on
8. ❌ Reinvent the wheel - Use existing services and scripts
9. ❌ Ignore loading states - Users need feedback
10. ❌ Leave console.logs - Clean up debug code

### ALWAYS Rules (Things that must be done)
1. ✅ Check existing services first - Reuse before creating
2. ✅ Use TypeScript types - Type safety prevents bugs
3. ✅ Handle all states - Loading, error, empty, success
4. ✅ Test with Admin SDK - Verify data integrity
5. ✅ Follow role-based access - Filter data by user role
6. ✅ Optimize queries - Use where clauses, limit results
7. ✅ Document your code - Future you will thank you
8. ✅ Ask before assumptions - Clarify requirements
9. ✅ Test edge cases - Empty data, errors, large datasets
10. ✅ Clean up mock data - Remove all traces

## Required Tools & Access
- Firebase Admin SDK access
- Existing services (InstitutionHierarchyService, RBACService, etc.)
- Existing scripts in /src/scripts/ directory
- Firestore security rules understanding
- Environment variables configured

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All Mock Data Removed
- ✅ All Features Functional
- ✅ All Roles Contextualized
- ✅ All Dashboards Interconnected
- ✅ All Tests Pass
- ✅ Production Ready

## Next Steps
The implementation can now begin with Sprint 1. The team should:

1. Begin with Sprint 1: Foundation
2. Implement InstitutionDashboardService methods
3. Update RBAC system for institution-level permissions
4. Enhance authentication hooks
5. Follow the service-first approach for each sprint
6. Test thoroughly after each implementation
7. Document all changes
