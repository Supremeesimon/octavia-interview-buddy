2. Run the test script to verify everything works:
   ```
   node test-structured-data.mjs
   ```
3. You should see "Report processed successfully"

## Data Flow

1. VAPI processes the call and generates analysis based on your configuration
2. When the call ends, VAPI sends an "End of Call Report" to your webhook:
   ```
   https://us-central1-octavia-practice-interviewer.cloudfunctions.net/vapiWebhook
   ```
3. Your Firebase Function receives and processes the structured data
4. Data is saved to Firestore in the "end-of-call-analysis" collection
5. Your application retrieves this data to display feedback to users

## Benefits of This Configuration

1. **Comprehensive Feedback**: Candidates receive detailed, structured feedback
2. **Institutional Analytics**: Data can be aggregated for institutional dashboards
3. **Performance Tracking**: Students can track their improvement over time
4. **Role-Based Insights**: Different stakeholders can view relevant data
5. **Automated Processing**: No manual intervention required

This configuration will provide rich, actionable insights for both candidates and institutional administrators.
