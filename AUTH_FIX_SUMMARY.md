# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were experiencing the "Authentication required: Please log in to complete this purchase" error even when they were already logged in. This occurred because:

1. JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
2. When tokens expired, API calls to protected endpoints failed with a 403 error and message "Invalid or expired token"
3. The AuthService refreshToken method was not actually refreshing tokens but always throwing an error
4. The SessionService was handling 401 errors directly instead of letting the API client handle token refresh

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive fix with the following changes:

### 1. Updated AuthService (`src/services/auth.service.ts`)
- Fixed the `refreshToken()` method to actually attempt token refresh using the new token utilities
- Removed the placeholder implementation that always threw an error
- Added proper error handling and session cleanup

### 2. Enhanced Token Utilities (`src/utils/token-utils.ts`)
- Added detailed logging to track the token refresh process
- Improved error handling and debugging information

### 3. Enhanced API Client (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- Added detailed logging to track token refresh attempts
- Improved error handling and debugging information
- Maintained the automatic token refresh mechanism

### 4. Simplified SessionService (`src/services/session.service.ts`)
- Removed redundant 401 error handling from individual methods
- Let the API client handle token refresh centrally
- Maintained clean, consistent error handling

## How It Works Now
1. When an API call fails with a 403 "Invalid or expired token" error:
   - The API client automatically detects this specific error
   - It attempts to refresh the token using the updated AuthService method
   - During refresh, other requests are queued
   - If refresh succeeds, queued requests are retried with the new token
   - If refresh fails, users are properly redirected to login

2. Token refresh process:
   - Gets current Firebase user
   - Requests a fresh Firebase ID token
   - Exchanges the Firebase token for a new backend JWT
   - Updates the auth token in the API client

## Benefits
- Seamless user experience with automatic token refresh
- No more confusing authentication messages when users are actually logged in
- Centralized token management reduces code duplication
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better performance with request queuing during refresh

## Testing
The solution has been tested to ensure:
- Token refresh works correctly when tokens expire
- Queued requests are properly handled during refresh
- Error messages are clear and helpful to users
- Performance is maintained with minimal overhead

## Future Improvements
- Implement proactive token refresh before expiration
- Add more sophisticated error handling for different token expiration scenarios
- Enhance the token utility functions with additional features like token prefetching
