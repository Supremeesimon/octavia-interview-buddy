# Token Refresh Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were experiencing the "Session expired. Please log in again" error even when they were already logged in. This occurred because:

1. JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
2. When tokens expired, API calls to protected endpoints failed with 403 errors
3. The frontend didn't have a proper mechanism to automatically refresh expired tokens
4. Users were confused because they were still logged into Firebase but couldn't access protected resources

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive token refresh mechanism with the following components:

### 1. Token Utilities (`src/utils/token-utils.ts`)
Created utility functions for:
- `refreshToken()`: Gets a fresh Firebase ID token and exchanges it for a new backend JWT
- `isTokenExpired()`: Checks if the current token is expired (not currently used but available for future use)

### 2. API Client Enhancement (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)
Enhanced the API client with automatic token refresh capabilities:
- Automatic detection of token expiration (403 errors with "Invalid or expired token" message)
- Request queuing during token refresh to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts
- Automatic retry of failed requests after successful token refresh
- Proper error handling when token refresh fails

### 3. Simplified Session Service (`src/services/session.service.ts`)
Removed redundant token refresh logic from individual methods since it's now handled centrally in the API client:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Consistent error handling across all methods
- Reduced code duplication

## How It Works
1. When an API call fails with a 403 "Invalid or expired token" error:
   - The API client automatically attempts to refresh the token
   - During refresh, other requests are queued
   - If refresh succeeds, queued requests are retried with the new token
   - If refresh fails, users are redirected to login

2. Token refresh process:
   - Gets current Firebase user
   - Requests a fresh Firebase ID token
   - Exchanges the Firebase token for a new backend JWT
   - Updates the auth token in the API client

## Benefits
- Seamless user experience with automatic token refresh
- No more confusing "Session expired" messages when users are actually logged in
- Centralized token management reduces code duplication
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better performance with request queuing during refresh

## Testing
The solution has been tested to ensure:
- Token refresh works correctly when tokens expire
- Queued requests are properly handled during refresh
- Error messages are clear and helpful to users
- Performance is maintained with minimal overhead

## Future Improvements
- Implement proactive token refresh before expiration
- Add more sophisticated error handling for different token expiration scenarios
- Enhance the token utility functions with additional features like token prefetching
