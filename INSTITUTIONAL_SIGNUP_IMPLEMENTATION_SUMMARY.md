# Dynamic Department Management & Institutional Login Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of two critical features for the institutional signup flow:
1. **Dynamic Department Creation** - Departments are created automatically based on signup, with a dropdown showing existing departments
2. **Institutional Login Link Fix** - "Sign in" link on institutional signup should keep institutional context

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated InstitutionalSignup Component
**File:** `src/pages/InstitutionalSignup.tsx`

- Added dynamic department fetching on page load using `InstitutionHierarchyService.getDepartmentsByInstitutionName`
- Implemented autocomplete functionality with dropdown showing existing departments
- Replaced plain text input with enhanced department selection that allows both selecting existing departments and typing new ones
- Fixed "Sign in" link to preserve institutional context using query parameters (`/login-institution?token={token}`)

### 2. Created InstitutionalLogin Component
**File:** `src/pages/InstitutionalLogin.tsx`

- Created new component for institutional login with token validation
- Implemented proper authentication flow that verifies users belong to the institution
- Added appropriate redirects based on user roles (teacher, student, admin)
- Removed Google login button to maintain institutional context
- Added link back to institutional signup with preserved token

### 3. Updated Routing
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

- Added new route for institutional login: `/login-institution`
- Imported and configured lazy loading for the new InstitutionalLogin component

### 4. Enhanced Signup Logic
**File:** `src/services/firebase-auth.service.ts`

- Updated department matching to be case-insensitive
- Improved department creation logic to prevent duplicates
- Enhanced both email/password and Google OAuth signup flows
- Added better error handling for institutional user creation

### 5. Created Test Script
**File:** `src/scripts/test-institutional-signup.ts`

- Created comprehensive test suite to verify implementation against production database
- Tests cover all required scenarios:
  - First user creating a department
  - Second user joining existing department
  - Dropdown showing existing departments
  - Sign in link preserving token
  - Institutional login validating token
  - Institutional login blocking external users

## Key Features Implemented

### Dynamic Department Management
- Departments are fetched dynamically from Firestore on page load
- Autocomplete dropdown shows existing departments as users type
- Case-insensitive matching prevents duplicate departments
- Users can select existing departments or create new ones
- Proper hierarchical structure maintained in Firestore

### Institutional Login Context Preservation
- "Sign in" link on signup page now preserves institutional context
- New institutional login page validates tokens and restricts access
- Users are redirected to appropriate dashboards based on their roles
- External users are blocked from institutional login pages

## Technical Details

### Department Matching Logic
The implementation uses case-insensitive matching to prevent duplicate departments:
1. First tries exact match using Firestore query
2. If not found, performs case-insensitive search through all departments
3. Creates new department only if no match is found

### Token Validation
- Institutional login validates tokens against the production database
- Invalid or expired tokens redirect users to the external login page
- User authorization is verified against the institution before login

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all Firebase operations
- Graceful degradation when departments or institutions are not found
- Proper cleanup of Firebase Auth users when Firestore operations fail

## Testing
The implementation has been designed for production use with:
- Real institution IDs from the production database
- Actual tokens from production Firestore
- Case sensitivity handling for department names
- Proper validation of user-institution relationships
