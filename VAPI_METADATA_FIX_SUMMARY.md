# VAPI Metadata Fix Summary

## Problem Description

When users completed interviews, the system was only saving data to the `end-of-call-analysis` collection in Firestore, but not to the `interviews` and `interview-feedback` collections. This caused the student dashboard to show empty sections for Interview History, Latest Feedback, and Performance Analysis.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that the user identification metadata ([studentId](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/types/index.ts#L131-L131), departmentId, institutionId) was not being properly preserved and passed through the VAPI event chain:

1. **Frontend correctly passed metadata**: The [InterviewInterface.tsx](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/components/InterviewInterface.tsx) component correctly extracted the authenticated user's [studentId](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/types/index.ts#L131-L131) and passed it to the VAPI service.

2. **VAPI service correctly prepared metadata**: The [VapiService](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/services/vapi.service.ts#L37-L977) correctly prepared the metadata and passed it to the VAPI SDK.

3. **Metadata was lost in VAPI events**: When VAPI sent events (analysis, call-end), the metadata was not included in the event data.

4. **Service tried to retrieve missing metadata**: When handling events, the service tried to get metadata from `this.currentCall?.metadata`, which was empty or incomplete.

5. **Firebase function received incomplete data**: Because the metadata was missing, the Firebase webhook function didn't have the [studentId](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/types/index.ts#L131-L131) needed to save data to the [interviews](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/types/index.ts#L35-L35) and `interview-feedback` collections.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Metadata Preservation in VAPI Service

**File**: [src/services/vapi.service.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/services/vapi.service.ts)

**Changes**:
- Added a separate `callMetadata` property to store metadata independently
- Modified the `startInterview` method to store metadata in both `this.currentCall.metadata` and `this.callMetadata`
- Updated event handlers to use `this.callMetadata` as a fallback when `this.currentCall.metadata` is not available
- Added cleanup of `this.callMetadata` when calls end

### 2. Fixed Navigation Issue

**File**: [src/components/InterviewInterface.tsx](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/components/InterviewInterface.tsx)

**Changes**:
- Modified `handleScheduleMore` to navigate to `/student?tab=interviews` instead of `/student`
- This ensures users land on the correct Interviews tab after completing an interview

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the system should now:

1. ✅ Correctly preserve user metadata throughout the VAPI interview process
2. ✅ Save complete interview data to all three Firestore collections:
   - `end-of-call-analysis` (analysis data)
   - [interviews](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/types/index.ts#L35-L35) (interview records)
   - `interview-feedback` (feedback and scores)
3. ✅ Display complete interview history and feedback in the student dashboard
4. ✅ Navigate users to the correct dashboard tab after completing interviews

## Verification Steps

1. Log in as an authenticated user
2. Start an interview from the student dashboard
3. Complete the interview with the AI
4. Check Firestore collections for data in all three collections
5. Verify dashboard sections are populated with interview data
6. Confirm navigation works correctly when clicking "Schedule More Interviews"

## Additional Notes

- The Firebase webhook function was already correctly implemented to handle metadata
- The issue was purely in the frontend VAPI service metadata preservation
- Anonymous users will continue to work as expected, with data saved only to `end-of-call-analysis`
