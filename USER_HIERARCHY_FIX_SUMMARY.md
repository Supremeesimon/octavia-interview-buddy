# User Hierarchy Fix Summary

This document summarizes the work completed to fix the user-institution-department-teacher-student hierarchy linking in the Octavia Interview Buddy platform.

## Problem Statement

The initial database structure had several issues:
1. Users were not properly linked to institutions
2. No departments existed in the database
3. No proper hierarchy linking between teachers and students
4. Users had invalid institution domains (like gmail.com)

## Solution Implemented

We created and executed several scripts to fix the data structure:

### 1. User Hierarchy Linking Fix (`fix-user-hierarchy-linking.cjs`)
- Fixed the existing institution with proper domain
- Created 5 sample departments
- Linked all users to the institution
- Assigned users to appropriate departments
- Created teacher-student relationships

### 2. Verification Script (`verify-user-hierarchy.cjs`)
- Confirms all users are properly linked
- Validates the hierarchy structure
- Checks department-teacher-student relationships

### 3. Documentation (`SIGNUP_HIERARCHY_LINKING.md`)
- Explains the correct user hierarchy
- Documents the signup process flow
- Provides implementation plan for future improvements

## Results

After running the fix scripts, the database now has the correct structure:

### Institutions
- **Lethbridge Polytechnic** (ID: WxD3cWTybNsqkpj7OwW4)
  - Domain: lethbridgepolytechnic.ca
  - Active: true

### Departments
1. Computer Science (ID: JUTao6BPNocUW7Ysjg3E)
2. Business Administration (ID: u8ZDLgkvTknw7XzU5KU5)
3. Engineering (ID: zLj70FISxJR0wTRqOixN)
4. Health Sciences (ID: swBOdgcag4lk138VsjA2)
5. Arts & Humanities (ID: zMf9aMjpnbuPHi3cUWz8)

### Users with Proper Linking
1. **Sarah** (outreach@autolawn.cloud) - Teacher
   - Role: `teacher`
   - Institution: Lethbridge Polytechnic
   - Department: Computer Science
   - Department ID: JUTao6BPNocUW7Ysjg3E

2. **Simon Onabanjo** (supremeesimon@gmail.com) - Platform Admin
   - Role: `platform_admin`
   - No institution linking (as expected for platform admin)
   - No department (as expected for platform admin)

3. **Onabanjo Oluwaferanmi** (oluwaferanmionabanjo@gmail.com) - Student
   - Role: `student`
   - Institution: Lethbridge Polytechnic
   - Department: Computer Science
   - Department ID: JUTao6BPNocUW7Ysjg3E
   - Teacher: Sarah (outreach@autolawn.cloud)

## Verification

The verification script confirms that:
- All users are properly linked to institutions
- Teachers and students are assigned to departments
- Students are linked to their teachers
- The hierarchy structure is maintained

## Next Steps

To maintain this structure during ongoing user registration:

1. **Implement Custom Signup Links**
   - Platform admins generate custom links for institutions
   - Links include institution ID and user role
   - Links can have expiration dates

2. **Enhance Signup Pages**
   - Validate custom signup links before allowing registration
   - Automatically link users to institutions based on links
   - Remove free-text department entry

3. **Implement Department Assignment**
   - Allow institution admins to assign users to departments after signup
   - Create proper teacher-student relationships through the admin interface

4. **Add Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Ensure users can only access data within their hierarchy level

## Files Created

1. `src/scripts/fix-user-hierarchy-linking.cjs` - Fixes user hierarchy linking
2. `src/scripts/verify-user-hierarchy.cjs` - Verifies the hierarchy structure
3. `SIGNUP_HIERARCHY_LINKING.md` - Documentation for proper signup implementation
4. `USER_HIERARCHY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## How to Reset and Test

When you want to reset the data and test the signup process:

1. Delete all documents in the collections:
   ```bash
   # You would need to create a script to delete all documents
   # Or use the Firebase Console to delete collections
   ```

2. Run the signup process with the enhanced implementation that:
   - Uses custom signup links
   - Properly assigns roles
   - Links users to institutions
   - Allows department assignment through admin interface

The foundation is now in place for a properly structured user hierarchy that supports the multi-institution, multi-department model.
