- **Updated**: [userBelongsToDepartment()](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/services/rbac.service.ts#L134-L150) method to properly check department membership

### 2. Script Files

#### [src/scripts/list-users.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/scripts/list-users.ts)
- **Updated**: Script to work with the new hierarchical structure
- Now lists users from platformAdmins, externalUsers, and institutional collections

#### [src/scripts/set-platform-admin.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/scripts/set-platform-admin.ts)
- **Updated**: Script to search across all collections and move users to the platformAdmins collection
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy users collection

#### [get-institution-data.cjs](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/get-institution-data.cjs)
- **Updated**: Script to fetch data from all collections in the hierarchical structure
- Provides comprehensive view of institutions and users

#### [src/scripts/test-auth.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/scripts/test-auth.ts)
- **Updated**: Script to work with the new hierarchical structure
- Tests authentication across all user types

#### [src/scripts/test-hierarchical-auth.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/scripts/test-hierarchical-auth.ts)
- **Added**: New comprehensive test script to verify all authentication flows

## Implementation Details

### User Creation Flow
1. **Platform Admins**: Created in `platformAdmins/{adminId}` collection
2. **External Users**: Created in `externalUsers/{userId}` collection
3. **Institutional Users**: Created in appropriate subcollections:
   - Institution Admins: `institutions/{institutionId}/admins/{adminId}`
   - Teachers: `institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/teachers/{teacherId}`
   - Students: `institutions/{institutionId}/departments/{departmentId}/students/{studentId}`

### User Lookup Flow
The new `findUserById()` method searches in this order:
1. Platform Admins collection
2. External Users collection
3. All institutional collections (admins, departments, teachers, students)

### Role Detection
The updated RBAC service now properly detects roles by searching all collections in the hierarchical structure.

## Testing Requirements

After these changes, the following signup flows work correctly:

1. **External User Signup**
   - Users sign up with email/password
   - Created in `externalUsers/{userId}` collection
   - Can log in successfully

2. **Google OAuth Signup**
   - Users sign up with Google
   - Created in `externalUsers/{userId}` collection
   - Can log in successfully

3. **Institutional Teacher Signup**
   - Users sign up through institutional signup link with teacher role
   - Created in `institutions/{instId}/departments/{deptId}/teachers/{userId}`
   - Can log in successfully
   - Role is correctly identified as "teacher"

4. **Institutional Student Signup**
   - Users sign up through institutional signup link with student role
   - Created in `institutions/{instId}/departments/{deptId}/students/{userId}`
   - Can log in successfully
   - Role is correctly identified as "student"

5. **RBAC Verification**
   - All users can log in and their roles are correctly identified
   - Access control works properly (users can only access their own data)

## Expected Outcomes

✅ External users sign up → Created in `externalUsers/`
✅ Google OAuth users → Created in `externalUsers/`
✅ Institutional teachers → Created in proper subcollection
✅ Institutional students → Created in proper subcollection
✅ All users can log in successfully
✅ Role detection works for all user types
✅ Access control properly restricts data

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, the following rollback steps can be taken:
1. Revert the service files to their previous versions
2. Update scripts to use the old "users" collection structure
3. Migrate any new users created in the hierarchical structure back to the flat structure
