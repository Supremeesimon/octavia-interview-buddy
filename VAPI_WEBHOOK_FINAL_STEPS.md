# Final Steps: VAPI Webhook Configuration

## Current Status
✅ Your Firebase Function webhook is successfully deployed and working
✅ Test request confirmed the function is processing data correctly

## Where to Configure Webhook in VAPI Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Webhooks Section**
   - Look in the left sidebar for "Webhooks" or "Integrations"
   - If not there, check under "Settings" menu
   - You're currently in the "Tools" section, which is different

2. **Create New Webhook**
   - Click "Add Webhook" or "Create Webhook"
   - Name it something like "Octavia Interview Buddy Webhook"

3. **Configure Webhook Settings**
   - **URL**: `https://us-central1-octavia-practice-interviewer.cloudfunctions.net/vapiWebhook`
   - **Event**: Select "End of Call Report" (this is the important part)
   - **Method**: POST (should be default)
   - **Content Type**: application/json (should be default)

4. **No Schema Configuration Needed**
   - Unlike Tools, Webhooks don't require you to define the request body schema
   - VAPI will automatically send the end-of-call report data in the correct format

5. **Save and Test**
   - Save your webhook configuration
   - Run a test interview to verify data is being captured

## Verification

You can verify the webhook is working by:

1. Running an interview in your application
2. Ending the interview
3. Checking your Firebase Firestore for new documents in the "end-of-call-analysis" collection

## Important Notes

- The interface you were looking at is for "Tools", which is a different VAPI feature
- Webhooks are configured in a separate section of the VAPI Dashboard
- You don't need to define request body properties for webhooks
- Webhooks automatically receive data when the selected event occurs

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see data in Firestore after testing:

1. Check Firebase Function logs:
   ```
   firebase functions:log
   ```

2. Verify the webhook URL is correct:
   ```
   https://us-central1-octavia-practice-interviewer.cloudfunctions.net/vapiWebhook
   ```

3. Confirm "End of Call Report" event is selected in the webhook configuration

## Success Confirmation

The successful test response you received confirms everything is working:
```
Report processed successfully
```

This means your system is ready to automatically capture and store end-of-call reports from VAPI.
