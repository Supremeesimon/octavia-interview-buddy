- Updated [set-platform-admin.ts](file:///Users/simon/AI%20interview%20Buddy%20/octavia-interview-buddy/src/scripts/set-platform-admin.ts) to search across all collections and move users to the platformAdmins collection

## Testing Requirements

After these changes, the following signup flows should work correctly:

1. **External User Signup**
   - Users sign up with email/password
   - Created in `externalUsers/{userId}` collection
   - Can log in successfully

2. **Google OAuth Signup**
   - Users sign up with Google
   - Created in `externalUsers/{userId}` collection
   - Can log in successfully

3. **Institutional Teacher Signup**
   - Users sign up through institutional signup link with teacher role
   - Created in `institutions/{instId}/departments/{deptId}/teachers/{userId}`
   - Can log in successfully
   - Role is correctly identified as "teacher"

4. **Institutional Student Signup**
   - Users sign up through institutional signup link with student role
   - Created in `institutions/{instId}/departments/{deptId}/students/{userId}`
   - Can log in successfully
   - Role is correctly identified as "student"

5. **RBAC Verification**
   - All users can log in and their roles are correctly identified
   - Access control works properly (users can only access their own data)

## Expected Outcomes

✅ External users sign up → Created in `externalUsers/`
✅ Google OAuth users → Created in `externalUsers/`
✅ Institutional teachers → Created in proper subcollection
✅ Institutional students → Created in proper subcollection
✅ All users can log in successfully
✅ Role detection works for all user types
✅ Access control properly restricts data
