# Scheduled Price Changes Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the scheduled_price_changes Firestore collection and its integration with the Platform Admin Control Panel.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Firestore Collection Creation
- Created the `scheduled_price_changes` collection in Firestore
- Updated the initialization script to ensure the collection exists
- The collection stores scheduled price changes for global pricing parameters

### 2. PriceChangeService Updates
- Verified that the PriceChangeService is properly configured to work with the `scheduled_price_changes` collection
- The service provides methods to:
  - Create new scheduled price changes
  - Retrieve all price changes
  - Get upcoming price changes (filtered by 'scheduled' status)
  - Update existing price changes
  - Delete price changes

### 3. FinancialManagement Component Integration
- The FinancialManagement component already had proper integration with the PriceChangeService
- Added a refresh function to ensure scheduled changes are updated in real-time
- Added periodic refresh to keep the UI up to date

### 4. Data Structure
The scheduled_price_changes collection stores documents with the following structure:
- `changeDate`: Date - When the price change should take effect
- `changeType`: 'vapiCost' | 'markupPercentage' | 'licenseCost' - Which pricing parameter to change
- `affected`: 'all' | string - Which institutions are affected ('all' for global changes)
- `currentValue`: number - Current value of the parameter
- `newValue`: number - New value of the parameter
- `status`: 'scheduled' | 'applied' | 'cancelled' - Status of the change
- `createdAt`: Date - When the scheduled change was created
- `updatedAt`: Date - When the scheduled change was last updated

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify:
1. Collection creation and initialization
2. Service functionality (CRUD operations)
3. Integration with the FinancialManagement component

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Admin Control Panel
2. Go to the Financial tab
3. In the Pricing Control section, modify any pricing parameter
4. Enable scheduling and select a future date
5. Click "Schedule Changes"
6. The scheduled change will appear in the Price Change Schedule section
