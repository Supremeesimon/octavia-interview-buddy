// Test 3: Mock data
const mockData = {
  overallPerformanceGrade: "D",
  gradeExplanation: "The aggregated overall rating across the two completed interview sessions is 61.5 (average of 65 and 58). This result indicates that, on average, platform users are currently demonstrating minimal competency and require significant improvement to reach satisfactory (C-level) performance.",
  dataLinkingStatus: "The collected data is not currently linked to specific institutional identifiers or individual student metadata. All analysis is based solely on two anonymous, aggregated reports.",
  studentImprovementAssessment: "As we only have data from two baseline sessions today, it is impossible to assess improvement trends. However, the platform is successfully identifying clear performance deficiencies, confirming its immediate value in highlighting weaknesses. The current baseline suggests students are struggling significantly.",
  keyInsight: "Technical Knowledge is the weakest area of aggregate performance (average score of 52.5), suggesting this skill category needs immediate attention through targeted platform scenarios or curriculum adjustments at the institutional level."
