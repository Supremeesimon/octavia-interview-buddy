// Test to verify the institution data fix
console.log('Institution Data Fix Verification:');
console.log('================================');

console.log('Issue Identified:');
console.log('- Institution tab was showing "Lethbridge Polytechnic" as owner of anonymous data');
console.log('- This created a misleading impression about data ownership');
console.log('- The actual interview data is from anonymous users, not linked to any institution');

console.log('\nFixes Applied:');
console.log('1. Modified getInstitutionData() to return "Anonymous Users" instead of real institutions');
console.log('2. Modified getInstitutionPerformanceData() to return "Anonymous Users" with 0% score');
console.log('3. Updated UI to show "Data from anonymous users" instead of institution distribution');
console.log('4. Updated Performance Overview to show "Anonymous Users" instead of institution names');
console.log('5. Changed tab label from "Institutions" to "Anonymous Data"');
console.log('6. Updated General Insights section to be more accurate about anonymous data');

console.log('\nExpected Results:');
console.log('- Platform Usage section shows "Data from anonymous users" with "2 interview analyses collected today"');
console.log('- Performance Overview shows "Anonymous Users" with average performance score');
console.log('- General Insights section shows generic insights about anonymous data');
console.log('- Tab label now correctly shows "Anonymous Data" instead of "Institutions"');
