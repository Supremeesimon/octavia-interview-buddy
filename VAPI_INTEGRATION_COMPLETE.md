- **Webhook Configured**: Added to VAPI Dashboard with "End of Call Report" events
- **Functionality Verified**: Tested with sample data and received successful responses

## ‚úÖ Analysis Configuration
You've configured all three components of VAPI's Analysis feature:

### 1. Summary Generation
- **Prompt**: Expert note-taker focusing on candidate performance, strengths, and areas for improvement
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Minimum Messages**: 2

### 2. Success Evaluation
- **Prompt**: HR professional evaluation based on coherent responses, technical knowledge, communication skills, and engagement
- **Rubric**: Automatic breakdown into multiple criteria with scores
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds

### 3. Structured Data Extraction
- **Categories**: Communication Skills, Technical Knowledge, Problem Solving, Enthusiasm
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Strengths, Areas for Improvement, Recommendations
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds

## ‚úÖ End-to-End Testing
- **Webhook Functionality**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- **Structured Data Processing**: ‚úÖ All fields processed properly
- **Metadata Handling**: ‚úÖ Student, department, and institution data captured
- **Firestore Integration**: ‚úÖ Data saved to end-of-call-analysis collection

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Test with Real Interviews
- Run a few test interviews using your configured assistant
- End the calls and verify data appears in Firestore

### 2. Monitor Firebase Function Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

### 3. Check Firestore Data
Use the provided script to verify data is being saved:
```bash
node check-firestore-data.mjs
```

### 4. Verify in Application
- Check that interview data appears in your application's analytics
- Verify that anonymous users' data is properly isolated
- Confirm authenticated users can access their historical data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **No Data in Firestore**
   - Check Firebase Function logs: `firebase functions:log`
   - Verify webhook URL in VAPI Dashboard
   - Run test script: `node final-comprehensive-test.mjs`

2. **Incomplete Data**
   - Review Analysis configuration in VAPI Dashboard
   - Check that all required fields are marked appropriately
   - Verify timeout settings are sufficient

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure Firebase credentials are properly configured
   - Check Firestore security rules

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

1. **Reliable Data Capture**: Webhook ensures data is captured even if users close browsers
2. **Rich Analytics**: Structured data provides comprehensive feedback for candidates
3. **Institutional Insights**: Metadata enables role-based dashboards and analytics
4. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Firebase Functions automatically scale with demand
5. **Secure Processing**: Server-to-server communication enhances security
